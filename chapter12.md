# <a name="Chapter12"></a><a name="Image Filters"></a> 12 Image Filters

Image filters allow images to be modified and/or combined using a variety of imaging operations. Operations are carried out using a bit depth greater than or equal to the largest bit depth of the supplied images. The lower-left corners of all source and destination images are aligned. The destination area to be written is the intersection of the source and destination image areas. The entire source image area is used as the filter input. The source and destination images involved in the filter operation must not overlap (i.e., have any pixels in common within any common ancestor image). Source and destination images may have a common ancestor as long as they occupy disjoint areas within that area.

## <a name="Chapter2.1"></a><a name="Format_hormalization"></a> 12.1 _Format Normalization_

A series of steps are carried out on application-supplied source images in order to produce normalized source images for filtering. In practice, these normalizations may be combined with the filter operations themselves for efficiency.

The source pixels are converted to one of `sRGBA`, `sRGBA_PRE`, `lRGBA`, or `lRGBA_PRE` formats, as determined by the current values of the `VG_FILTER_FORMAT_PREMULTIPLIED` and `VG_FILTER_FORMAT_LINEAR` parameters. The conversions take place in the following order (equivalent to the conversion rules defined in Section 3.4):

1. Source color and alpha values are scaled linearly to lie in a [0, 1] range. The exact precision of the internal representation is implementation-dependent.
2. If the source image has premultiplied alpha, the alpha values are divided out of each source color channel, and stored for later use. If the source image has no alpha channel, an alpha value of 1 is added to each pixel.
3. If the source pixel is in a grayscale format (`lL` or `sL`), it is converted to an RGB format (`lRGB` or `sRGB`, respectively) by replication.
4. If the `VG_FILTER_FORMAT_LINEAR` parameter is set to `VG_TRUE`, and the source pixel is in non-linear format, it is converted into the corresponding linear format (`sRGBA`→`lRGBA`). If the `VG_FILTER_FORMAT_LINEAR` parameter is set to `VG_FALSE`, and the source pixel is in linear format, it is converted into the corresponding non-linear format (`lRGBA`→`sRGBA`).
5. If the `VG_FILTER_FORMAT_PREMULTIPLIED` parameter is equal to `VG_TRUE`, each source color channel is multiplied by the corresponding alpha value. Otherwise, the color channels are left undisturbed.

An implementation may collapse steps algebraically; for example, if no conversion is to take place in step 4, the division and multiplication by alpha in steps 2 and 5 may be implemented as a no-op.

The resulting pixel will be in `sRGBA`, `sRGBA_PRE`, `lRGBA`, or `lRGBA_PRE` format. The image filter then processes each of the four source channels in an identical manner, resulting in a set of filtered pixels in the same pixel format as the incoming pixels.

Finally, the filtered pixels are converted into the destination format using the normal pixel format conversion rules, as described in section 3.4. Premultiplied alpha values are divided out prior to color-space conversion, and restored afterwards if necessary. The destination channels specified by the `VG_FILTER_CHANNEL_MASK` parameter (see below) are written into the destination image.

## <a name="Chapter12.2"></a><a name="Channel_Masks"></a> _12.2 Channel Masks_

#### <a name="VGImageChannel"></a> _VGImageChannel_

All image filter functions make use of the `VG_FILTER_CHANNEL_MASK` parameter that specifies which destination channels are to be written. The parameter is supplied as a bitwise OR of values from the `VGImageChannel` enumeration. If the destination pixel format is one of `VG_sL_8`, `VG_lL_8` or `VG_BW_1` pixel format, the parameter is ignored. If the destination pixel format does not contain an alpha channel, the `VG_ALPHA` bit is ignored. Bits other than those defined by the `VGImageChannel` enumeration are ignored.

`VG_FILTER_CHANNEL_MASK` controls which color channels of the filtered image are written into the destination image. In the case where the destination image is premultiplied, and `VG_FILTER_CHANNEL_MASK` does not specify that all channels are to be written, the following steps are taken to ensure consistency:

1. If `VG_FILTER_FORMAT_PREMULTIPLIED` is enabled, the filtered color channels are clamped to the range [0, alpha], and converted into nonpremultiplied form (as described in Section 3.4)
2. The resulting color is converted into the destination color space
3. The destination is read and converted into non-premultiplied form
4. The destination channels specified by `VG_FILTER_CHANNEL_MASK` are replaced by the corresponding filtered values
5. The results are converted into premultiplied form and written to the destination image

```c
typedef enum {
  VG_RED   = (1 << 3),
  VG_GREEN = (1 << 2),
  VG_BLUE  = (1 << 1),
  VG_ALPHA = (1 << 0)
} VGImageChannel;
```

## <a name="Chapter12.3"></a><a name="Color_Combination"></a> _12.3 Color Combination_

Color channel values may be combined using the **vgColorMatrix** function, which computes output colors as linear combinations of input colors.

#### <a name="vgColorMatrix"></a> _vgColorMatrix_

The **vgColorMatrix** function computes a linear combination of color and alpha values $(R_{src}, G_{src}, B_{src}, \alpha_{src})$ from the normalized source image `src` at each pixel:

or:

$$
\left[
  \begin{matrix}

## <a name="Chapter12.4"></a><a name="Convolution"></a> _12.4 Convolution_

The **vgConvolve**, **vgSeparableConvolve**, and vgGaussianBlur functions define destination pixels based on a weighted average of neighboring source pixels, a process known as `convolution`. The set of weights, along with their relative locations, is known as the `convolution kernel`. In the discussion below, width and `height` refer to the dimensions of the source image.

#### <a name="VG_MAX_KERNEL_SIZE"></a> _VG_MAX_KERNEL_SIZE_

The `VG_MAX_KERNEL_SIZE` parameter contains the largest legal value of the `width` and `height` parameters to the **vgConvolve** function. All implementations must define `VG_MAX_KERNEL_SIZE` to be an integer no smaller than 7. If there is no implementation-defined limit, a value of `VG_MAXINT` may be returned. The value may be retrieved by calling **vgGeti**:

```c
VGint maxKernelSize = vgGeti(VG_MAX_KERNEL_SIZE);
```

#### <a name="VG_MAX_SEPARABLE_KERNEL_SIZE"></a> _VG_MAX_SEPARABLE_KERNEL_SIZE_

The `VG_MAX_SEPARABLE_KERNEL_SIZE` parameter contains the largest legal value of the `size` parameter to the **vgSeparableConvolve** function. All implementations must define `VG_MAX_SEPARABLE_KERNEL_SIZE` to be an integer no smaller than 15. If there is no implementation-defined limit, a value of `VG_MAXINT` may be returned. The value may be retrieved by calling **vgGeti**:

```c
VGint maxSeparableKernelSize = vgGeti(VG_MAX_SEPARABLE_KERNEL_SIZE);
```

#### <a name="VG_MAX_GAUSSIAN_STD_DEVIATION"></a> _VG_MAX_GAUSSIAN_STD_DEVIATION_

The `VG_MAX_GAUSSIAN_STD_DEVIATION` parameter contains the largest legal value of the `stdDeviationX` and `stdDeviationY` parameters to the **vgGaussianBlur** function. All implementations must define `VG_MAX_GAUSSIAN_STD_DEVIATION` to be an integer no smaller than 16. If there is no implementation-defined limit, a value of `VG_MAXINT` may be returned. The value may be retrieved by calling **vgGeti**:

```c
VGint maxGaussianStdDeviation = vgGeti(VG_MAX_GAUSSIAN_STD_DEVIATION);
```

#### <a name="vgConvolve"></a> _vgConvolve_

The **vgConvolve** function applies a user-supplied convolution kernel to a normalized source image `src`. The dimensions of the kernel are given by `kernelWidth` and `kernelHeight`; the kernel values are specified as `kernelWidth*kernelHeight` `VGshorts` in column-major order. That is, the kernel entry $(i, j)$ is located at position $i*kernelHeight + j$ in the input sequence. The `shiftX` and `shiftY` parameters specify a translation between the source and destination images. The result of the convolution is multiplied by a `scale` factor, and a `bias` is added.

The output pixel $(x, y)$ is defined as:

$$
s(\sum_{0\le i\lt w}\sum_{0\le j\lt h} k_{(w-i-1),(h-j-1)}p(x+i-shiftX,y+j-shiftY))+b,
$$

where w = `kernelWidth`, h = `kernelHeight`, ki,j is the kernel element at position $(i, j), s$ is the `scale`, b is the bias, and $p(x, y)$ is the source pixel at $(x, y)$, or the result of source edge extension defined by `tilingMode`, which takes a value from the `VGTilingMode` enumeration (see Section 9.4.1). Note that the use of the kernel index $(w–i–1, h–j–1)$ implies that the kernel is rotated 180 degrees relative to the source image in order to conform to the mathematical definition of convolution when `shiftX` = w – 1 and `shiftY` = h - 1. Figure 27 depicts the flipping of the kernel relative to the image pixels for a 3x3 kernel.

The operation is applied to all channels (color and alpha) independently. Version 1.1

```c
void vgConvolve(VGImage dst, VGImage src,
                VGint kernelWidth, VGint kernelHeight,
                VGint shiftX, VGint shiftY,
                const VGshort * kernel,
                VGfloat scale,
                VGfloat bias,

#### <a name="vgSeparableConvolve"></a> _vgSeparableConvolve_

The **vgSeparableConvolve** function applies a user-supplied separable convolution kernel to a normalized source image `src`. A separable kernel is a two-dimensional kernel in which each entry $kij$ is equal to a product $kxi * kyj$ of elements from two onedimensional kernels, one horizontal and one vertical.

The lengths of the one-dimensional arrays `kernelX` and `kernelY` are given by `kernelWidth` and `kernelHeight`, respectively; the kernel values are specified as arrays of `VGshorts`. The `shiftX` and `shiftY` parameters specify a translation between the source and destination images. The result of the convolution is multiplied by a `scale` factor, and a `bias` is added.

The output pixel $(x, y)$ is defined as:



where w = `kernelWidth`, h = `kernelHeight`, $kxi$ is the one-dimensional horizontal kernel element at position $i$, $kyj$ is the one-dimensional vertical kernel element at position $j$, $s$ is the `scale`, b is the bias, and $p(x, y)$ is the source pixel at $(x, y)$, or the result of source edge extension defined by `tilingMode`, which takes a value from the `VGTilingMode` enumeration (see Section 9.4.1). Note that the use of the kernel indices $(w–i–1)$ and $(h–j–1)$ implies that the kernel is rotated 180 degrees relative to the source image in order to conform to the mathematical definition of convolution.

```c
void vgSeparableConvolve(VGImage dst, VGImage src,
                         VGint kernelWidth, VGint kernelHeight,
                         VGint shiftX, VGint shiftY,
                         const VGshort * kernelX,
                         const VGshort * kernelY,
                         VGfloat scale,
                         VGfloat bias,

#### <a name="vgGaussianBlur"></a> _vgGaussianBlur_

The **vgGaussianBlur** function computes the convolution of a normalized source image `src` with a separable kernel defined in each dimension by the Gaussian function $G(x, s)$:

$$G(x,s)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi s^2}}e^{-\frac{x^2}{2s^2}}$$

where $s$ is the _standard deviation_.

The two-dimensional kernel is defined by multiplying together two one-dimensional kernels, one for each axis:

$$k(x,y)=G(x,s_x)*G(y,s_y)=\frac{1}{2\pi s_xs_y}e^{-(\frac{x^2}{2s_x^2}+\frac{y^2}{2s_y^2})}$$

where $sx$ and $sy$ are the (positive) standard deviations in the horizontal and vertical directions, given by the `stdDeviationX` and `stdDeviationY` parameters respectively. This kernel has special properties that allow for very efficient implementation; for example, the implementation may use multiple passes with simple kernels to obtain the same overall result with higher performance than direct convolution. If `stdDeviationX` and `stdDeviationY` are equal, the kernel is rotationally symmetric.

Source pixels outside the source image bounds are defined by `tilingMode`, which takes a value from the `VGTilingMode` enumeration (see Section 9.4.1)

The operation is applied to all channels (color and alpha) independently.

```c
void vgGaussianBlur(VGImage dst, VGImage src,
                    VGfloat stdDeviationX,
                    VGfloat stdDeviationY,

## <a name="Chapter12.5"></a><a name="Lookup Tables"></a> _12.5 Lookup Tables_

#### <a name="vgLookup"></a> _vgLookup_

The **vgLookup** function passes each image channel of the normalized source image `src` through a separate lookup table.

Each channel of the normalized source pixel is used as an index into the lookup table for that channel by multiplying the normalized value by 255 and rounding to obtain an 8-bit integral value. Each `LUT` parameter should contain 256 `VGubyte` entries. The outputs of the lookup tables are concatenated to form an `RGBA_8888` pixel value, which is interpreted as `lRGBA_8888`, `lRGBA_8888_PRE`, `sRGBA_8888`, or `sRGBA_8888_PRE`, depending on the values of `outputLinear` and `outputPremultiplied`.

The resulting pixels are converted into the destination format using the normal pixel format conversion rules.

```c
void vgLookup(VGImage dst, VGImage src,
              const VGubyte * redLUT,
              const VGubyte * greenLUT,
              const VGubyte * blueLUT,
              const VGubyte * alphaLUT,
              VGboolean outputLinear,
              VGboolean outputPremultiplied)

#### <a name="vgLookupSingle"></a> _vgLookupSingle_

The **vgLookupSingle** function passes a single image channel of the normalized source image `src`, selected by the `sourceChannel` parameter, through a combined lookup table that produces whole pixel values. Each normalized source channel value is multiplied by 255 and rounded to obtain an 8 bit integral value.

The specified `sourceChannel` of the normalized source pixel is used as an index into the lookup table. If the source image is in a single-channel grayscale (`VG_lL_8`, `VG_sL_8`, or `VG_BW_1`) or alpha-only (`VG_A_1`, `VG_A_4`, or `VG_A_8`) format, the `sourceChannel` parameter is ignored and the single channel is used. The `lookupTable` parameter should contain 256 4-byte aligned entries in an `RGBA_8888` pixel value, which is interpreted as `lRGBA_8888`, `lRGBA_8888_PRE`, `sRGBA_8888`, or `sRGBA_8888_PRE`, depending on the values of `outputLinear` and `outputPremultiplied`.

The resulting pixels are converted into the destination format using the normal pixel format conversion rules.

```c
void vgLookupSingle(VGImage dst, VGImage src,
                    const VGuint * lookupTable,
                    VGImageChannel sourceChannel,

# <a name="13_Color_Transformation_and_Blending"></a> 13 Color Transformation and Blending

In the final pipeline stage, the pixels from the previous pipeline stage (paint generation or image interpolation) are optionally transformed by a color transformation matrix. If image drawing is taking place using the `VG_DRAW_IMAGE_STENCIL` mode, the color transformation is applied to the incoming paint pixels.

The resulting pixels are converted into the destination color space, and blending is performed using a subset of the standard Porter-Duff blending rules [PORT84] along with several additional rules.

## <a name="Chapter13.1"></a><a name="Color_Transformation"></a> _13.1 Color Transformation_

If the `VG_COLOR_TRANSFORM` parameter is enabled, each color from the preceding pipeline stage (or the incoming paint color for the `VG_DRAW_IMAGE_STENCIL` computation) is converted to non-premultiplied form. If the color is in a luminance format, it is converted to a corresponding RGBA format. Each channel is multiplied by a per-channel scale factor, and a per-channel bias is added:

$$A^{'}=A\times S_a+B_a$$$$
R^{'}=R\times S_r+B_r$$$$
G^{'}=A\times S_g+B_g$$$$
B^{'}=A\times S_b+B_b$$


Scale and bias values are input in floating point format but are then modified as follows:

- Scale parameters are clamped to the range [-127.0, +127.0]. The precision may be reduced but it must be at least the equivalent of signed 8.8 fixed point (1 sign bit, 7 integer bits and 8 fractional bits).
- Bias parameters are clamped to the range [-1.0, +1.0]. The precision may be reduced but must be at least the equivalent of 1.8 fixed point (1 sign bit and 8 fractional bits).

The precision of the color transform computations must be at least the equivalent of 8.8 fixed point (1 sign bit, 7 integer bits and 8 fractional bits).

The results for each channel are clamped to the range [0, 1].

#### <a name="Setting_the_Color_Transformation"></a> _Setting the Color Transformation_

The color transformation is set as a vector of 8 floats, consisting of the R, G, B, and A scale factors followed by the R, G, B, and A biases:

```c
/* Sr, Sg, Sb, Sa, Br, Bg, Bb, Ba */
VGfloat values[] = { 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 };
vgSetfv(VG_COLOR_TRANSFORM_VALUES, 8, values);
vgSeti(VG_COLOR_TRANSFORM, VG_TRUE);
```

## <a name="Chapter13.2"></a><a name="Blending_Equations"></a> _13.2 Blending Equations_

A blending mode defines an alpha blending function $\alpha (\alpha_{src}, \alpha_{dst})$ and a color blending function $c(c_{src}, c_{dst}, \alpha_{src}, \alpha_{dst})$. Given a non-premultiplied source alpha and color tuple $(R_{src}, G_{src}, B_{src}, \alpha_{src})$ and a non-premultiplied destination alpha and color tuple $(R_{dst}, G_{dst}, B_{dst}, \alpha_{dst})$, blending replaces the destination with the blended tuple $(c(R_{src}, R_{dst}, \alpha_{src}, \alpha_{dst}), c(G_{src},G_{dst},\alpha_{src},\alpha_{dst}),c(B_{src},B_{dst},\alpha_{src},\alpha_{dst}),\alpha(\alpha_{src},\alpha_{dst}))$.

If either the source or destination is stored in a premultiplied format (_i.e._, pixels are stored as tuples of the form $(\alpha *R, \alpha *G, \alpha *B, \alpha))$, the alpha value is conceptually divided out prior to applying the blending equations described above. If the destination is premultiplied, the destination color values are clamped to the range [0, alpha] when read, and the destination alpha value is multiplied into each color channel prior to storage. If the destination format does not store alpha values, an alpha value of 1 is used in place of $\alpha_{dst}$.

## <a name="Chapter13.3"></a><a name="Porter-Duff_Blending"></a> _13.3 Porter-Duff Blending_

Porter-Duff blending defines an alpha value $\alpha (\alpha_{src}, \alpha_{dst}) = \alpha_{src} * F_{src} + \alpha_{dst} * F_{dst}$ and color $c^{'}(c_{src}^{'}, c_{dst}^{'}, \alpha_{src}, \alpha_{dst}) = c_{src}^{'} * F_{src} + c_{dst}^{'} * F_{dst}$, where $F_{src}$ and $F_{dst}$ are defined by the blend mode and the source and destination alpha values according to Table 15 below and $c^{'} = \alpha*c$ is a premultiplied color value. For non-premultiplied colors, we define the equivalent formula $c(c_{src}, c_{dst}, \alpha_{src}, \alpha_{dst}) = (\alpha_{src} * c_{src} * F_{src} + \alpha_{dst} * c_{dst} * F_{dst}) / \alpha (\alpha_{src}, \alpha_{dst})$ (taking the value to be 0 where division by 0 would occur).

Porter-Duff blending modes are derived from the assumption that each additional primitive being drawn is uncorrelated with previous ones. That is, if a previously drawn primitive $p$ occupies a fraction $f_p$ of a pixel, and a new primitive $q$ occupies a fraction $f_q$, Porter-Duff blending assumes that a fraction $f_p * f_q$ of the pixel will be occupied by both primitives, a fraction $f_p - f_p * f_q = f_p(1 - f_q)$ will be occupied by $p$ only, and a fraction $f_q - f_p * f_q = f_q(1 - f_p)$ will be occupied by $q$ only. A total fraction of $f_p + f_q - f_p * f_q$ of the pixel is occupied by the union of the primitives.

## <a name="Chapter13.4"></a><a name="Additional_Blending_Modes"></a> _13.4 Additional Blending Modes_

A number of additional blending modes are available. These modes are a subset of the SVG image blending modes. Note that the SVG "Normal" blending mode is equivalent to the Porter-Duff "Src **over** Dst" mode described above. The additional blend modes have the following effects:

- `VG_BLEND_MULTIPLY` – Multiply the source and destination colors together, producing the effect of placing a transparent filter over a background. A black source pixel forces the destination to black, while a white source pixel leaves the destination unchanged. If all alpha values are 1, this reduces to multiplying the source and destination color values.
- `VG_BLEND_SCREEN` – The opposite of multiplication, producing the effect of projecting a slide over a background. A black source pixel leaves the destination unchanged, while a white source pixel forces the destination to white. If all alpha values are 1, this reduces to adding the source and destination color values, and subtracting their product.
- `VG_BLEND_DARKEN` – Compute (Src **over** Dst) and (Dst **over** Src) and take the smaller (darker) value for each channel. If all alpha values are 1, this reduces to choosing the smaller value for each color channel.
- `VG_BLEND_LIGHTEN` – Compute (Src **over** Dst) and (Dst **over** Src) and take the larger (lighter) value for each channel. If all alpha values are 1, this reduces to choosing the larger value for each color channel.

The new destination alpha value for the blending modes defined in this section is always equal to $\alpha (\alpha_{src}, \alpha_{dst})=\alpha_{src}+\alpha_{dst}*(1-\alpha_{src})$, as for Porter-Duff "Src **over** Dst" blending. The formulas for each additional blending mode are shown in Table 16. The right-hand column contains the pre-multiplied output values, that is, the products of the new color value $c(c_{src}, c_{dst}, \alpha_{src}, \alpha_{dst})$ and alpha value $\alpha(\alpha_{src}, \alpha_{dst})$. The source and destination color values $c_{src}$ and $c_{dst}$ are given in non-premultiplied form.

**Blend Type**          | $c'(c_{src}, c_{dst}, \alpha_{src}, \alpha_{dst})$     
 :--------------------- | :--------------------------------------
 `VG_BLEND_MULTIPLY`    | $\alpha_{src} * c_{src} * (1 -\ alpha_{dst}) + \alpha_{dst} * c_{dst} * (1 - \alpha_{src}) + \alpha_{src} * c_{src} * \alpha_{dst} * c_{dst}$
 `VG_BLEND_SCREEN`      | $\alpha_{src} * c_{src} + \alpha_{dst} * c_{dst} - \alpha_{src} * c_{src} * \alpha_{dst} * c_{dst}$
 `VG_BLEND_DARKEN`      | $min(\alpha_{src} * c_{src} + \alpha_{dst} * c_{dst}  * (1 - \alpha_{src}), \alpha_{dst} * c_{dst} + \alpha_{src} * c_{src} * (1 - \alpha_{dst}))$
 `VG_BLEND_LIGHTEN`      | $max(\alpha_{src} * c_{src} + \alpha_{dst} * c_{dst} * (1 - \alpha_{src}), \alpha_{dst} * c_{dst} + \alpha_{src} * c_{src} * (1 - \alpha_{dst}))$

The Porter-Duff assumption of uncorrelated alpha described above does not hold for primitives that are known to be disjoint (for example, a set of triangles with shared vertices and edges forming a mesh, or a series of text glyphs that have been spaced according to known metrics). In these cases, we expect no portion of the pixel to be occupied by both primitives and a total fraction of $fp + fq$ to be occupied by the union of the primitives. The _additive_ blending rule may be used in this case. It sets the final alpha value of the blended pixel to the clamped sum $\alpha(\alpha_{src},\alpha_{dst})=min(\alpha_{src}+\alpha_{dst},1)$ and the color to $c(c_{src}, c_{dst})=min((\alpha_{src}*c_{src}+\alpha_{dst}*c_{dst})/min(\alpha_{src}+\alpha_{dst},1),1)$. If all alpha values are 1, this reduces to adding the values of each source color channel and clamping the result.

#### <a name="VGBlendMode"></a> _VGBlendMode_

The `VGBlendMode` enumeration defines the possible blending modes:

```c
typedef enum {
  VG_BLEND_SRC = 0x2000,
  VG_BLEND_SRC_OVER = 0x2001,
  VG_BLEND_DST_OVER = 0x2002,
  VG_BLEND_SRC_IN = 0x2003,
  VG_BLEND_DST_IN = 0x2004,
  VG_BLEND_MULTIPLY = 0x2005,
  VG_BLEND_SCREEN = 0x2006,
  VG_BLEND_DARKEN = 0x2007,
  VG_BLEND_LIGHTEN = 0x2008,
  VG_BLEND_ADDITIVE = 0x2009
} VGBlendMode;
```
Use **vgSeti** with a parameter type of `VG_BLEND_MODE` to set the blend mode:

```c
VGBlendMode mode;
vgSeti(VG_BLEND_MODE, mode);
```
